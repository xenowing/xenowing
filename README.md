# xenowing

A WIP "[demo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) console" modeled after late '90's-/early 2000's-era game consoles, currently targeting the [Mimas A7](https://numato.com/product/mimas-a7-artix-7-fpga-development-board-with-ddr-sdram-and-gigabit-ethernet) FPGA dev board.

This is a hobby project made with the intention of learning more about designing/developing custom hardware, inspired by game consoles of the late '90's and early 2000's. I'm working on this entirely on my own, but I feel the code and progress are worth sharing, hence a public repo.

The xenowing is still in fairly early stages. You can follow progress at this repo and/or via streams on my [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ferrisstreamsstuff)/[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4mpLlHn0FOekNg05yCnkzQ) channels (particularly, [this youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-sXmdrqqYYeDcTxD-t6i-lgzmzbjKOBe)).

[This first stream recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSWyQJO0ho0&list=PL-sXmdrqqYYeDcTxD-t6i-lgzmzbjKOBe&index=1) and [this 2019 stream recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVqGz1IXEIA&list=PL-sXmdrqqYYeDcTxD-t6i-lgzmzbjKOBe&index=11) should provide a good overview of where the project is headed.

## Contribution

Major contributions are not encouraged at this time, as the project is in flux and is generally a personal project that I'm doing for fun. There are a lot of moving parts, and I'd rather keep them under my own control, at least for the time being.

That said, small PR's are welcome for typo fixes/obvious things.
