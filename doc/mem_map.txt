Notes
 - Registers are marked R, W, or R/W, depending on intended usage.
 - Reads from regs not marked R and writes to regs marked W have undefined behavior.
 - Reads and writes to undefined addresses in the memory map have undefined behavior.
 - Bits other than the ones specifically listed for system registers are undefined. Their values should be ignored on reads, and should be 0 on writes.

High-level map (note that not all addresses within the following ranges are necessarily valid; see detailed map for more info)

0x10000000 - 0x10001fff: Program ROM
0x20000000 - 0x22000007: System regs
0x30000000 - 0x3001ffff: RAM

Detailed mem map

0x10000000 - 0x1000ffff: Program ROM

0x20000000 - 0x20000003: LED interface (R/W, only word 0 used). Bits 0, 1, and 2 correspond to the 3 available LED's (0 = off, 1 = on).

0x21000000 - 0x21000003: UART transmitter status (R). Bit 0 indicates ready status (1 = ready, 0 = busy).
0x21000004 - 0x21000007: UART transmitter write (W). Bits 0-7 indicate data to be transmitted. When not busy, a write to this reg will start a new transmission immediately. If busy, the write is ignored.

0x22000000 - 0x22000003: Display status (R). Bit 0 indicates vblank status.
0x22000004 - 0x22000007: Framebuffer base address (W). This is a 14-bit address to a 64-bit word which contains the first four pixels of the current framebuffer. The address specified is in bytes for convenience, but bits 0-2 and bits 17-31 are all ignored.

0x30000000 - 0x3001ffff: RAM
